# Natural-Language-Processing-on-yelp-reviews
This project explores 100,000 Yelp reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis, text mining (POS, n-grams, Word2Vec, LDA), and sentiment classification. Multiple ML and deep learning models (Naive Bayes, LSTM, RNN, BERT, RoBERTa) are evaluated for performance.
